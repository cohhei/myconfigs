	 // Place your snippets for Markdown here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	 // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	 // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	 // same ids are connected.
	 // Example:
	 "Print to console": {
		"prefix": "table",
		"body": [
			" | ${1:column} | ${2:column} | ",
			" | ------ | ------ | ",
			" | ${3:value}  | ${4:value}  | ",
			" | ${5:value}  | ${6:value}  | " 
		],
		"description": "table"
	}
